<p>
    You can do a lot in 1,000 lines of code. A retrieval system blending a Dewey browser and an interactive 'live' search is presented which is currently implemented in about 1,000 lines. As the user types, the system searches for records, classifies those records into DDC categories, and displays them using standard protocols. The data structures needed to support this are computed in parallel using a Python implementation of map-reduce.

<p>
    Common methods of publishing book content have focused on various
    implementations of existing technologies such as LaTeX, Markdown, and
    .epub. A common theme within this development has been the separation of
    presentation layers and content layers. What if there was another way?
    In responding to that question, we’ll look at our local @msulibrary
    prototype software funded by an IMLS Sparks! Innovation grant for
    presenting books inside of web browsers
    (https://github.com/jasonclark/bib-template). Our talk will focus on the
    tools and technologies of open web publishing. We’ll consider the
    strange and wonderful benefits of integrating the presentation layer and
    content layer using semantic RDFa HTML5 markup, and we’ll demonstrate
    how describing and displaying books within an open web model impacts
    discovery, eBook production, and machine-readability.

    Our session will include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>The benefits of using RDFa, Schema.org, and linked data models for
        book production</li>
    <li>How structured data models for book content can turn your webpage
        into your API</li>
    <li>Analyze the effects of this practice for machine-understanding, SEO,
        and UX</li>
    <li>Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this model as it applies
        to a range of book genres, including web book prototypes for fiction
        and poetry.</li>
</ul>

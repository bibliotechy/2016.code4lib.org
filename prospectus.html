      <p style="margin-top:20px">Code4Lib would love your support to help us run our big annual conference!  Being an autonomous group of professionals with no organizational umbrella,
       we are an experiment in community-driven organizing and the generosity of others.  In addition to moving technology forward in libraries, archives, and museums, the visibility
       you get from sponsoring at Code4Lib can generate sales, spark interest, inspire, and delight our attendees.  If you're ready to make a pledge, or have more questions, get in touch with <a href="mailto:shaune@princeton.edu">Shaun Ellis</a>.</p>

      <h2>Who is Code4Lib?</h2>
      <p>Code4Lib is a core community of

          developers and technologists for libraries,

          museums, and archives who have a strong

          commitment to open technologies.

          Code4Lib began as a simple mailing list in

          2003 and held its first face-to-face

          meeting in 2005 in Chicago. The first

          official annual conference was held in

          2006 in Corvallis, Oregon. Code4Lib is

          dedicated to being a diverse and inclusive

          community seeking to

          share ideas and build collaboration.
      </p>

      <h2>About the Code4Lib 2016 Conference</h2>
      <p>The Code4Lib 2016 conference, held at the

          Society Hill Sheraton from March 7-10,

          presents an opportunity for vendors,

          organizations, libraries, and projects to show

          their support for open and collaborative

          solutions for higher education, libraries,

          museums, and archives through attending

          the conference and providing financial

          sponsorship. Each year, the Code4Lib

          conference helps revitalize the community

          as participants meet in person to discuss

          new and ongoing projects in a single-track

          format with 20-minute presentations and

          5-minute lightning talks. Volunteer-led

          pre-conference programs provide in-depth

          participatory learning experiences for

          participants while ad-hoc afternoon

          breakout sessions focus on collaboration

          around specific topics of interest.
